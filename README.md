#### Requirements

* Install `node 14.17.x` [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)

## Quick Overview

Inside the project folder, you can run some commands:

### `npm install` or `yarn install`

Install the necessary dependencies:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

## Note

When using the address of the challenge query the distributor `(PoC): Rua Américo Brasiliense, São Paulo` I noticed that the neighborhood information does not come correct from Google, only when searching for zip code `04715-002` which obtained the response correct.
